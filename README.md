# Google-Plus-Rendered-Share-Button

A rendered button that lets you share interactive posts on Google+. Credit to the Google+ Developers' Website for the code at: https://developers.google.com/+/web/share/interactive (I have slightly edited the code).

## Prerequisites

- Google APIs Console Project
- Share button prerequisites
- Call-to-action label

NOTE: In both files, you must replace the default `xxxx.apps.googleusercontent.com` on the `clientid` with your Client ID URL.
